## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js & npm:** Make sure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). (Version 18.x or later recommended).
*   **Git:** Required for cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Supabase Account & Database:**
    *   Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
    *   Create a new project.
    *   Navigate to your project's Database settings and find your Connection String (usually under "Connection pooling" -> "URI"). You'll need this!

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your GitHub Username]/EXPENSE-TRACKER-2.git
    cd EXPENSE-TRACKER-2
    ```
    *(Replace `[Your GitHub Username]`)*

2.  **Install dependencies:** Install the required packages listed in the root `package.json`. Run this command from the **root** (`EXPENSE-TRACKER-2`) directory:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application Locally

### Environment Variables

The backend needs your database connection string to connect to Supabase. For local development:

1.  Create a file named `.env` inside the `src/backend/` directory (`src/backend/.env`).
2.  Add your Supabase connection string to this file:
    ```dotenv
    # src/backend/.env
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-HOST]:[YOUR-PORT]/postgres
    ```
    *(Replace the placeholder with your **actual** Supabase connection string, including your database password).*
3.  **Important:** The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this `.env` file from being committed to Git, keeping your password safe.

### Start the Server

1.  Make sure you are in the **root** directory (`EXPENSE-TRACKER-2`) of the project in your terminal.
2.  Run the start script defined in the root `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3.  The terminal should show messages indicating the server is running and connected to the database:
    ```
    Connected to the PostgreSQL database via pool.
    Expenses table checked/created successfully.
    Initial database client released.
    Server listening on port 3000
    Access locally at: http://localhost:3000
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints under the `/api` prefix:

*   `GET /api/expenses`: Retrieves all expenses, ordered by date descending.
*   `POST /api/expenses`: Adds a new expense. Expects a JSON body with `description`, `amount`, `category`, `date`.
*   `PUT /api/expenses/:id`: Updates an existing expense by its ID. Expects a JSON body with `description`, `amount`, `category`, `date`.
*   `DELETE /api/expenses/:id`: Deletes an expense by its ID.

## Deployment

This application is deployed and running live on **Render**.

*   **Live URL:** [https://expense-tracker-2-k92j.onrender.com] <!-- <<< REPLACE THIS URL -->
*   **Render Configuration (via Dashboard):**
    *   **Root Directory:** (Blank - uses repository root)
    *   **Build Command:** `npm install`
    *   **Start Command:** `npm start` (or `node src/backend/server.js`)
    *   **Environment Variable:** `DATABASE_URL` set securely via Render's environment settings.
